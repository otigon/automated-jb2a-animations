#### Thunderwave Notes

Thunderwave is currently set for DND5e rules based on a 15 ft. cube. When placing the template in 5e, the token who is casting the spell should be along an edge, at a corner, or inside the template.

Automated Animations picks an animation based on where the Token is in relation to the template.
